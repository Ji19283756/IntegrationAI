# IntegrationAI
Seeks to speed up integral calculations using AI

## How we do it

Whenever a trapezoidal reimann sum is used, increasing the 
amount of increments will slowly increase the accuracy of the predition
This project seeks to accomplish this task faster by
using previous calculations and using ai to predict the final
solution


## Data generation
to generate date we will use a datagenerate.py to give
the ai a lot of examples on different equations and their 
integrals
